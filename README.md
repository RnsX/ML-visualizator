# ML-visualizator

## Purpose
- This is a machine learning (1 layer neural network) model implementation using basic mathematics (MathJS).
- Application demonstrates the use of Javascript for creating mathematical machine learning models that can be executed within single HTML file
- Although creation of such solution is fun, it is really unpractical to do so without something like typescript or even more advaned libraries that abstract the complexities of machine learning algorithm creation (such as unnecessary coding of matrix / vector multiplications)

## Further development
- The idea is to create animations which represent how model 'learns' and creates functions matching the input data
- Also manual data entry is planned as currently the model is 'fed' data that is generated based on bounded-random numbers (to have any structure for model to learn from)

## Using / instalation
- Just open the HTML file in browser
